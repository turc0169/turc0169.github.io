README Wilfred Turcotte's Portfolio Website 
edited - March 27 2019
I created this portfolio mainly using CSS grid and flexbox. I found getting used to creating a website again from scratch was difficult. I actually had a lot of trouble with this assignment and despite spending so much time wasn�t able to complete it one hundred percent. 
I did stop my more complicated design and restarted with expectations a lot lower to have something to hand in. 
Many of the choices you�ll see in this version are that way so I would have a �finished� end product for submission.
But, the overall design was made to have no accessibility issues and be fairly simple to navigate. When completed the tiles I designed will also act as navigation tools and a further information tool on my services page.
I learned that everything can go very wrong and complicated very fast�  
No, I�m also taking a lesson away from this and that is having a finished product is better than shooting too high and not being able to finish.  
Even though I�ve been very excited to make this website I wasn�t able to dedicate the time towards it with other school work and independent living challenges. I�m very disappointed and regretful for how it is going to affect my grade but, looking at it as a learning experience, I am (trying) to finding my own value in it. 
Also, I will obviously be continuing to build this so I can have a portfolio website.
